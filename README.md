# NBA Discord Bot

[The NBA Discord Bot] is a [Discord](https://discord.com/) [Bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) developed by Lukar as a fun little project for personal use on their own Discord Server and learning purposes. A much more fleshed out version of the NBA Discord Bot can be found [here](https://github.com/NBABot-Development-Team/NBABot). File Structure is inspired by [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEEcbVjLyr0) and the assets directory was inspired by the [NBA Discord Bot](https://github.com/NBABot-Development-Team/NBABot). 

## Available Local Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `node src/index.js`

Runs the bot/file locally, but does not restart the bot automatically when any saved file changes are made in the directory

### `nodemon`

Runs the bot locally and restarts the bot automatically when any saved file changes are made in the directory. This works because package.json has already defined "main": src/index.js
